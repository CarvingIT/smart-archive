		<strong>Distinctive User permissions:</strong>
<p>You can manage different users by providing them unique user privileges that show them what they can do with the document.  This time itâ€™s not just Read and Write! You can enable customized permission for every user, meaning you can give read permission for some documents to a user and give write permission to other documents according to the user privileges. Fantastic! Right?</p>

The following permissions can be given to a user:

<ul>
<li>MAINTAINER: This gives the user the permission to maintain the document entirely.</li>

<li>CREATE: This gives the user the permission to create a new document.</li>

<li>EDIT_ANY: This gives the user the permission to edit any of the documents in the collection.</li>

<li>EDIT_OWN: This gives the user the permission to edit only those documents from the collection that has been created by the user.</li>

<li>DELETE_ANY: This gives the user the permission to delete any of the documents in the collection.</li>

<li>DELETE_OWN: This gives the user the permission to delete only those documents from the collection that has been created by the user.</li>

<li>VIEW: This gives the user the permission to view all documents in the collection.</li>
</ul>
